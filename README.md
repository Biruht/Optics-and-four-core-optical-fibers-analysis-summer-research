# Optics-and-four-core-optical-fibers-analysis-summer-research

##Summer 2020

  • Conducted research in optics and four-core optical fibers analysis.
  • Assembled a simple holography demonstration and performed a COMSOL Multiphysics simulation of a Holography Retrieval (Single-bit Hologram simulation).
  • Assembled an Open Cavity Laser using One-Brewster Window which has a visible beam while still providing convenient access to the inside of the   resonator.


Summer 2021

  • Assembled a classic Michelson Interferometer using Polarizing Beam-Splitter Cube (PBSC) and able to explore techniques for aligning interferometer and impact on the performance of the coherence length of a laser source.
